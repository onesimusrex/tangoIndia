DIVISION 27 COMMUNICATIONS
27 00 00 COMMUNICATIONS
27 01 00 Communications General Guidance
Design interior telecommunications infrastructure to meet the needs of the activity and supporting
facilities in accordance with this document. A/E contractor generated final drawings and specifications for
design-bid-build and design-build projects must be stamped by a BICSI Registered Communications
Distribution Designer (RCDD).
Note: Design and construction may be concurrent efforts in Design-Build projects, and multiple phases of
construction may be approved. Therefore, the final documents for each construction phase must be
stamped.
• Government-Designed Projects: On government-designed projects (in-house design) the government
designer must:
– Obtain the approval of the service appointed telecommunications agent, prior to bid, in
accordance with regulations, policies, memorandums, and guidance.
– Ensure that the bid documents require an RCDD stamp on the contractor’s telecommunications
shop drawings submitted for approval.
• Small Scale Projects: Small scale projects limited to adding work area outlets from existing
telecommunications rooms do not require an RCDD stamp provided the work is being accomplished
under the technical authority of an RCDD or the government telecommunications manager.
27 02 00 Communications Classified Infrastructure
Classified Infrastructure
Classified Infrastructure is any infrastructure that is used to transmit unencrypted classified National
Security Information (NSI). Examples would be the infrastructure to support classified networks such as
Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications
System (JWICS).
Coordinate the design of classified telecommunications infrastructure with the telecommunications
manager and the Certified Tempest Technical Authority (CTTA) responsible for that area. The following
documents may be applicable:
• CNSSAM TEMPEST/1-13 (FOUO); defines the RED/BLACK installation guidance to consider during
design and installation, and provides potential solutions 1
• CNSSI 7003 (U); provides guidance on Protected Distribution Systems. /1/

27 05 26 Grounding and Bonding for Communications Systems
[UFC 3-580-01 2-9 Grounding, Bonding, and Static Protection]
• Comply with NFPA 70 for grounding and bonding requirements. Provide a telecommunications
bonding and grounding system in accordance with TIA-607-B or current version. Building grounding
systems are covered in UFC 3-520-01 Interior Electrical Systems.
Design Guide | Working Draft
66 September 2019
• Note: The TIA-607-B identifies a bonding conductor known as the telecommunications bonding
backbone (TBB) which is intended to equalize potentials between TRs. It should be recognized that
the impedance of the TBB increases with length, thereby reducing its ability to equalize potentials
between TRs. The ITS designer must consider that the TBB for a large site may be very costly to
achieve. As an alternative, the TGB in each TR can be bonded to the electrical panel board in the TR
and to structural steel where applicable. Install bonding conductors in the shortest and most direct
paths feasible.
[UFC 3-580-01 2-9.1 Cable Entrance Grounding]
• Connect all metallic shields and strength members for outside plant cable entering a building to the
electrical service grounding electrode system in accordance with NFPA 70, Article 800. Bond the
OSP cable shield, armor, and metallic strength member to the main building ground as close as
possible to the building point of entrance with a No. 6 AWG or larger ground wire. Use a non-bonded
splice case for the transition from OSP rated cable to interior rated cable. If the designer extends the
OSP cable past 50 feet (15 m), 1 bond the metallic strength member /1/ to the TMGB with a No. 6
AWG or larger copper ground wire, as close to the conduit egress point as possible.
[UFC 3-580-01 2-9.1.1 Protected Entrance Terminals]
• Terminate all incoming OSP copper cables on UL-listed primary protector blocks, located within the
building entrance terminal cabinet. Provide protector blocks equipped with 5-pin solid state, gas, or
hybrid protector modules for the number of pairs terminated. Bond the protector blocks to the main
electrical service ground via the TMGB or TGB with a No. 6 AWG or larger copper ground wire.
[UFC 3-580-01 2-9.2 Telecommunications Spaces Bonding and Grounding]
• Bond all telecommunications spaces and infrastructure in accordance with TIA 607-B where

and baskets) in accordance with TIA-607-B. Non-continuous distribution systems (i.e. stub-ups, Jhooks)
do not require bonding.
27 05 28 Pathways for Communications Systems
Follow industry trends of roll pipe and air assisted cable pathway utilization in an effort to reduce the real
property cost and complexity of traditionally designed Maintenance Hole and Ducting Systems (MHDS)
from the Bell System era. The retirement of high pair count, large diameter copper cabling based plain old
telephone and Time Domain Multiplexing (TDM) equipment has greatly reduced the need for expensive
large capacity MHDS. New conduit and cabling system installation technologies have the potential to
render significant cost avoidance to the AFWP program because it can be designed with longer
uninterrupted spans and does not adhere to the same requirements for maximum number of degrees of
direction change before maintenance hole installation is needed for traditional “pulled installation” cable.
This results is far fewer Maintenance Holes/Hand Holes (MH/HH) within the design, reducing cost and
number of additional confined spaces to an installation’s infrastructure.
Telecommunications Pathways. A pathway is defined as a facility for the placement of
telecommunications cable.
Backbone Pathways:
• Backbone pathways (sometimes referred to as “vertical” pathways) are defined as structures that
conceal, protect, support, and provide access to cables between telecommunications spaces.
Examples of backbone pathways consist of conduit, sleeves, slots, cable tray, telecommunication
spaces, and miscellaneous support facilities.
Design Guide | Working Draft
September 2019 67
• For intra-building backbone distribution, provide a minimum of two 4-inch (103 mm) conduits between
TRs located on the same floor or pathway that provides equivalent capacity (e.g. cable tray installed
to support backbone and horizontal distribution). In multistory buildings, provide a minimum of three
4-inch (103 mm) conduits, sleeves, or an equivalent sized slot between stacked TRs on successive
floors in accordance with TIA-569-C.

27 05 29 Hangers and Supports for Communications Systems
Non-continuous Cable Supports
Non-continuous cable supports are not allowed in the following locations:
• In place of the cable tray system or as the sole distribution system in place of home-run conduit.
Design non-continuous cable supports to support the category-rating of the cable. Supports must not
exceed 20 cables or 50 percent of the fill capacity, whichever is less.
• That exceed 50 feet (15 meters) total length through a non-continuous cable support system.
Design Guide | Working Draft
74 September 2019
• Ceilings in which Infection Control protocol affects ceiling tile removal
• In areas where the cable must be protected.
When utilizing non-continuous cable supports, provide in accordance with TIA-569-C.
Horizontal Pathways
Horizontal pathways are defined as structures that conceal, protect, support, and provide access to
cables between the telecommunications spaces and the work area outlet. Examples of horizontal
pathways consist of conduit, cable trays, ceiling distribution, access floors, and non-continuous cable
supports (J-hooks).
There are many methods to distribute cable from the telecommunications space to the work area and
many buildings may require a combination of two or more types of pathway systems to meet all the
distribution needs. The DoD required horizontal pathway is a ceiling distribution system employing a
centralized cable tray system originating in the telecommunications space and continuing out into the
serving areas. Utilize cable tray for horizontal distribution to the maximum extent possible (80 to 90
percent of the horizontal cable length). The remaining pathway to the work area outlet may be
implemented in a variety of ways combining conduit, non-continuous cable supports, and stub-ups/outs.
Open Office Wiring
Open office wiring refers to work area spaces that are divided by modular furniture and partitions rather
than by fixed walls. The electrical designer, the architect, and the interior designer must coordinate the
layout of all furniture with electrical and telecommunications outlets during the design process. Furniture
is typically specified and ordered when construction is nearing completion; therefore, if proper
coordination has not occurred earlier in the design process, field interface problems will occur.
Systems Furniture
Utilize architectural columns and perimeter walls to the maximum extent possible for telecommunications
distribution to systems furniture workstations. In the absence of architectural columns or when systems
furniture is located away from perimeter walls, utilize utility columns where permitted. Only if no other
alternative exists, utilize under-floor conduits that are designed and installed in accordance with TIA-569-
C. Include a spare conduit to under-floor outlet boxes for future expansion. Design systems furniture
wiring connections in accordance with TIA-568-C and TIA-569-C.
Protection and Separation in Systems Furniture and Utility Columns
Ensure that the cable is protected at all transition points, and that metallic separation is provided between
telecommunication and power wiring in the utility columns and systems furniture track in accordance with
TIA-569-C and NFPA 70.
Horizontal Distribution in Small Facilities and Renovations
In new construction involving small, mixed use (non-administrative) facilities, or construction projects
involving renovation of existing buildings, use of J-hooks, flexible cable tray, and alternative support
systems specifically certified for Category 6 cable is permissible, though not desirable. In renovation
projects where access to the walls for installation of conduit and outlet boxes is not possible, or where
historical requirements prohibit the alteration of the building structure, surface mounted non-metallic
raceway may be use.
Design Guide | Working Draft
September 2019 75
27 05 33 Conduits and Backboxes for Communications Systems
Conduit
Design conduit systems in accordance with TIA-569-C. Install electrical metallic tubing (EMT) conduit
from the cable backbone distribution system, whether cable tray or enclosed duct, to each outlet unless a
conduit-less system is approved by the telecommunications manager. Provide a minimum of 1 inch (27
mm) EMT conduit for standard outlets. When cable tray or enclosed duct is not used, install individual
conduits from the TR to each outlet. Coordinate conduit bend radii with cable bend radius. Arrange
conduit entries at outlet and junction boxes so that cables passing through the box enter and exit at
opposite sides of the box. Do not use flexible metal conduit for telecommunications wiring except when
installing floor-access boxes in a raised floor, where the floor-access box may be relocated within a
specified service area. In this case the length of the flexible metal conduit 1 must /1/ not exceed a length
of 20 feet (6 m) for each run per TIA-569-C. Avoid using in-slab and below grade conduit systems for
interior telecommunications designs as these systems provide the least flexible horizontal distribution
system. If an in-slab or below grade conduit system is utilized in the telecommunications design, comply
with NFPA 70 and utilize cables that are listed and rated for wet locations. Do not use plenum or riser
rated cable, gel-filled OSP, and unlisted cables in such an environment. Consider that cables rated for a
wet location typically have a larger outside diameter and this may affect conduit fill rates and conduit
sizing. Larger conduit sizing in the slab may affect the structural integrity of the structure. For in-floor
conduit systems, provide home runs back to the TR serving that area. Serve all telecommunications
outlets from the TR located on that floor.
Use an optimal conduit fill ratio of 40 percent for conduit sizing. Do not exceed a fill ratio of 50 percent. Do
not install more than four, four-pair cables in a 1 inch (27 mm) conduit. Do not use conduit in family
housing projects unless it is a high-rise apartment building.
Pull and Splice Boxes
A pull box is defined as a housing located in a pathway run used to facilitate the placing of wire or cables.
A splice box is defined as a box located in a pathway run intended to house a cable splice. Place pull and
splice boxes in conduit runs in accordance with TIA-569-C.
27 05 36 Cable Trays for Communications Systems
Pathway Components
• Cable Tray
– Utilize solid bottom, slotted bottom, or welded wire cable tray to provide a centralized cable
management/distribution system.
 Use the cable tray for horizontal distribution to the maximum extent possible (80 percent to
90 percent of the horizontal cable length).
 Design cable trays to accommodate an initial calculated fill ratio of 25 percent (Note: This
allows for future growth within the cable tray. Due to random placement of cables and space
between the cables, a 25 percent fill ratio means that in reality the tray is half filled.)
 The maximum fill ratio of any cable tray is 50%.
 The maximum fill depth of any cable tray is 6 inches (150 mm).
 Do not use ladder cable trays for horizontal distribution due to possible cable deformation
with large cable quantities.
 Provide and maintain a minimum of 12 inches (300 mm) access headroom above a cable
tray system or cable runway.
 Coordinate with other disciplines to ensure that building components (e.g., air conditioning
ducts) do not restrict access and that proper clearances can be achieved.

finalized test plan to the Government. After the contractor has completed the installation and testing of the
ITS, the contractor must submit a test report for all fiber and copper cabling. The contractor’s RCDD must
approve both the test plan and the test report before submitting to the government.
Note: Test plans for small scale projects as delineated in paragraph 2-1.2 do not require RCDD approval.
Design Guide | Working Draft
September 2019 77
The test plan must include, along with all testing system reports, a complete project test summary
spreadsheet with indexed room numbers, outlet labels, jack labels and the pass/fail status, and causes
for failures along with a total number of outlets installed, jacks/cable runs installed and the total number of
jacks/cables runs that passed and failed the tests. All failed tests require the contractor to correct the
failures prior to turnover of the system. Tier 2 testing, data, analysis is required by the government at the
contractors’ expense if Tier 1 testing does not prove adequate for identifying causes of failures, and if the
government is responsible for paying for any repairs not within the original scope of contract.
Fiber Optic Patch Panels
Utilize patch panel connectors and couplers of the same type and configuration as used elsewhere in the
system. Utilize duplex LC connectors on 19-inch (475 mm) rack mounted panels, unless otherwise
directed. Provide a 3-foot (1-meter) slack loop of fiber within each panel, and include strain relief for
cables within the panel. Provide proper termination, splice storage, routing, radius limiting, cable
fastening, storage, and cross-connection in all patch panels. Install fiber optic patch panels in the same
rack or in the rack immediately adjacent to the LAN equipment in order to minimize patch cord lengths.
Provide a minimum spare capacity of 25 percent.
In existing facilities, other connector types may be used to match the current infrastructure, with the
approval of the telecommunications manager.

designated otherwise. Telecommunication-related antenna entrances and electronic equipment may also
be located in the EF. The demarcation point between the outside plant (OSP) cabling and the inside plant
distribution cabling is known as the building entrance terminal (BET).
Telecommunications Room (TR)
A telecommunications room (TR) is defined as an architectural space designed to contain
telecommunications equipment, cable terminations, and cross connect cabling. It contains the
Design Guide | Working Draft
78 September 2019
telecommunications equipment for connecting the horizontal cabling to the backbone cabling system. The
TR may also function as the telecommunications entrance facility.
Equipment Room (ER)
An equipment room (ER) is defined as an environmentally controlled, centralized space for
telecommunications equipment that usually houses a main or intermediate cross-connect. Any or all of
the functions of a telecommunications room or entrance facility may be provided by an equipment room.
Telecommunications Enclosure (TE)
A telecommunications enclosure (TE) is defined as a case or housing for telecommunications equipment,
cable terminations, and cross-connect cabling.
Although TEs serve much in the same capacity as that of a TR, a TE must not replace a TR. The TE is
also referred to as a Distributor Enclosure in TIA-569-C. TEs must meet the requirements for Distributor
Enclosures in TIA-569-C.
27 11 13 Communications Space Architectural Considerations [NEW]
Architectural Considerations
Location and Access
Locate telecommunications spaces central to the areas they serve and in such a manner that the
maximum cable length from the patch panel through the structured cabling system to the furthest outlet
does not exceed 295 feet (90 m). Telecommunications spaces must be dedicated spaces not shared with
other non-telecommunications functions (i.e., electrical rooms, mechanical rooms, plumbing, etc.). When
designing telecommunications spaces, avoid locations that are restricted by building components that
may limit expansion such as elevators, outside walls, or other fixed building walls. Locate spaces in an
accessible area of the building (e.g. common hallway) but limit access to personnel having a
telecommunications requirement or mission. Accessibility for the delivery of equipment such as network
switches, equipment racks and cabinets must be provided. Locate the telecommunications space away
from sources of electromagnetic interference or design the space to mitigate the effects of this
interference. Give special attention to electrical power supply transformers, motors and generators, X-ray
equipment, and radio or radar transmitters.
In renovation projects, avoid rooms containing transformers, air handling units, and similar equipment
types if at all possible. If shared facilities cannot be avoided, comply with TIA-569-C and maintain proper
electrical/telecommunications cable separations and provide working clearances per the National
Electrical Code (NEC).
Sizing and Quantity
Size ERs in accordance with TIA-568-C-1.1. Size each TR in accordance with TIA-568-C-1.1, except that
the minimum TR size for DoD buildings is 10 feet x 8 feet (3m x 2.4m). Generally, the TR should be sized
to approximately 1.1 percent of the area it serves. For example, a 10,000 sq feet (929 sq m) area should
be served by a minimum of one 10 ft x 11 feet (3 m x 3.4 m) TR. Divide large floor areas into “serving
areas” with TRs for each serving area. Each serving area can be no larger than 10,000 sq feet (929 sq m)
as stipulated in TIA-568-C-1.1. TR sizing, power, and HVAC requirements may be substantially impacted
if additional systems are required in the TR. Consult with the architectural designer or facilities engineer
when additional systems requirements (audio visual systems, servers, disk storage arrays, etc.) are
integrated into the TR. Consider utilizing an ER for areas that exceed 10,000 sq feet (929 sq m) or
buildings that house substantial Information Technology (IT) electronics. Provide a minimum of one TR
per floor. Provide additional rooms when the floor area is greater than 10,000 sq feet (929 sq m) and or
the total cable distance to the outlet is over 295 feet (90 m).
Design Guide | Working Draft
September 2019 79
Note: One TR may suffice for multi-story buildings in unique instances. Refer to section on Multi-Story
Buildings below.
Provide adequate space in TRs to facilitate tenant owned data and telecommunications systems, and
other low voltage systems such as fire alarm, CATV, CCTV, and electronic security systems (ESS).
Support equipment requirements in tenant installed freestanding cabinets or racks. Total TR space as a
percentage of the building’s area must be scaled upward, to reflect the increased number of circuits in
buildings with more than the standard number of circuits to each workspace.
Floors, Walls, and Ceilings
For floors, walls, and ceilings in telecommunications spaces, meet the requirements in TIA-569-C. Do not
install suspended ceilings in telecommunications spaces.
Doors and Windows
Doors must meet the requirements for TRs in TIA-569-C and NFPA 101. Telecommunications spaces
must not have windows or other architectural window equivalents.
Multi-Story Buildings
Provide a minimum of one TR on each floor, sized in accordance with paragraph Sizing and Quantity.
Serve all telecommunications outlets from the TR located on that floor. Vertically align TRs on successive
floors. In the case of small and unique facilities one TR may be sufficient for the entire facility. These
facilities include but are not limited to air traffic control towers, firing ranges, and range and weapons
towers.
Utility Considerations
Lighting
Design lighting for telecommunications spaces in accordance with UFC 3-530-01.
Power
Provide a dedicated electrical branch circuit panelboard for each TR with the following minimum
requirements: 120/208 volt, 3-phase or 120/240 volt, 1-phase, 24-(or 20 for 1-phase) space panel with a
minimum 100 ampere (A) bus rated capacity. Feed all loads within the TR, except lighting, from this
dedicated TR panel. Loads must include, but are not limited to, convenience receptacles, dedicated rack
or cabinet receptacles, and HVAC systems (including exterior units for split systems). Provide 125V, 20A
duplex convenience receptacles at 6 feet (1800mm) intervals on center around perimeter walls. When
required by the Activity, provide an additional dedicated 125V, 20A circuit on the wall above the entry
door for future electronic security system requirements. Coordinate with UFC 4-021-02, Electronic
Security Systems (ESS).
At a minimum, provide two multi-outlet power strips in each rack or cabinet. One power strip must be 240
or 208V, 1-phase; the other must be 120V 1-phase. To minimize accidental shut-off, equip power strips
with indicator lights, but no integral on/off switch. Provide matching (NEMA configured) twist-lock type
receptacles fed from dedicated circuits in the TR panel to power each power strip. Install twist-lock
receptacles above rack or cabinet, mounted to telecommunications cable tray or in ceiling space. As
some rack or cabinet mounted equipment may require larger quantities of electrical power, the designer
must consult with the local telecommunications group having jurisdiction to determine exact electrical
power requirements for each TR.
Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
Design telecommunication spaces to meet the HVAC requirements of TIA-569-C, including the Class B
requirements for temperature and humidity as outlined in ASHRAE TC 9.9.
Design Guide | Working Draft
80 September 2019
Room Climate Control
Provide each TR with its own independent thermostat for climate control, capable of supporting year
round ambient temperature control (24 hours/day, 365 days/year), to protect all installed electronic
equipment as defined in TIA-569-C and TIA-569-C-1. The mechanical system designer of record must
determine what type of system is necessary to meet the temperature and humidity requirements (e.g.
zoned, dedicated, split core). Do not include heating and cooling systems on building time clocks or other
temperature setback means for telecommunications spaces. Provide rooms with positive atmospheric
pressure to minimize dust.
Room Contaminants
Do not install information systems equipment in spaces where moisture, liquid or gaseous spillage, or
other contaminants may be present as defined in TIA-569-C.
Space Components
For all information transport system (ITS) components, provide manufacturer’s standard catalog products
that conform to the latest published industry and technical society standards at the date of contract
award. Do not use shop or field fabricated components that are not manufacturer’s standard catalog
products or that do not conform to the industry and technical society standards.
Plywood Backboards
Provide backboards in accordance with TIA-569-C. Backboards must be fire-retardant-treated wood,
bearing the manufacturer’s stamp. If painted, the manufactures fire rated stamp must remain visible.
Cover a minimum of two adjacent walls with backboards. When renovating an existing TR that does not
have adequate space, size the backboard as large as possible to accommodate wall mounted equipment.
Building Entrance Terminals
TIA-758 identifies two types of building entrance terminals (BET), protected and non-protected. Provide
protected terminals in accordance with TIA-758-B. Equip protected terminals with modules to protect the
inside plant cabling and equipment from power surges. Provide 110-type Insulation Displacement
Connector (IDC) terminal blocks or cable stubs.
Equipment Racks
Provide 19 inch (475mm) floor mounted equipment racks located at or near the center of the
telecommunication spaces. A minimum of 36 inches (900 mm) space both in front and in back of the rack,
measured from the equipment, and a minimum side clearance of 24 inches (600 mm) on at least one end
of the rack or row of adjacent racks is required. Coordinate with the telecommunications manager to
determine the space requirements for the government provided active equipment. Provide 25% spare
capacity within each utilized rack. Provide one spare rack for every four utilized racks with a minimum of
one spare rack per telecommunication space.
In existing facilities with narrow or crowded telecommunication spaces, equipment racks may be wallmounted
with the approval of the telecommunications manager. Refer to Figure 2-2.
Equipment Cabinets
Provide equipment cabinets in lieu of racks:
• Where identified by service specific chapters.
• Where physical security is required, such as to mount secure or mission critical equipment.
• In circumstances where separately controlled access is desired (when multiple systems are
collocated within the room).
Design Guide | Working Draft
September 2019 81
Provide a minimum of 24 inch (600 mm) wide cabinets with cooling fans and internal rails to support 19
inch (475 mm) equipment. Locate cabinets at or near the center of the telecommunication spaces. A
minimum space of 36 inches (900 mm), both in front and in back of the cabinet, and a minimum side
clearance of 24 inches (600 mm) on at least one end of the cabinet or row of adjacent cabinets is
required. Coordinate with the telecommunications manager to determine the space requirements for the
government provided active equipment. Provide 25% spare capacity within each utilized cabinet. Provide
one spare cabinet for every four utilized cabinets with a minimum of one spare cabinet per
telecommunication space.
In existing facilities with narrow or crowded telecommunication spaces, equipment cabinets may be wallmounted
with the approval of the telecommunications manager. Where space is limited and clearances
are affected, utilize swing out cabinets.
Horizontal and Vertical Cable Management
Install horizontal cable management panels above and below each patch panel. The required ratio of
horizontal cable management to patch panels is 1:1. Provide vertical cable management between racks
and at the end of racks when required to protect, manage, and organize cables. Vertical cable
management panels should be a minimum of 6-inch (150mm) wide.
Ladder and Wire Cable Tray
Utilize ladder type or welded wire cable tray in the telecommunication spaces to provide distribution
between the plywood backboard, equipment racks, backbone conduits, and the distribution cable tray.
Bond all metallic cable tray sections, and bond the cable tray system to the Telecommunications
Grounding Busbar (TGB) or Telecommunications Main Grounding Busbar (TMGB).
Unshielded Twisted Pair Patch Panels
For patch panels, use 8-position, 8-contact (8P8C) modular jacks, with rear mounted 110-type IDC
terminations, category rated for the Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) system being installed, and arrange in
rows or columns on 19-inch (475 mm) rack mounted panels. For small projects (i.e., fewer than ten users)
19-inch (475 mm) TIA category-qualified wall mounted block or backboard patch panels may be utilized.
Provide T568A jack pin/pair configuration per TIA-568-C.0. T568B jack pin/pair configuration may only be
used if required to maintain uniformity in an existing facility. Provide modular jacks that conform to the
requirements of TIA-568-C, and rated for use with the installed cable plant. Install UTP patch panels in
the same rack or in the rack immediately adjacent to the LAN equipment in order to minimize patch cord
lengths. Provide a minimum spare capacity of 25 percent.

Coordinate with the cable service provider where franchise agreements are in place.
2-7.4 Outlet Types and Density
The number of work area outlets per square area (outlet density) required in a building varies greatly
depending on the type of facility. Table 2-1 identifies facility space categories, work area outlet types, and
densities commonly used in military construction projects. The outlet configuration options identified in
Table 2-1 must be selected by the proponent and the telecommunications manager. The outlet types do
not cover all possible user required configurations. Provide user-defined outlets that have a
corresponding valid requirement, such as multiple levels of classification or dedicated systems. Provide
outlet configurations that comply with this UFC and the current versions of TIA-568 and TIA-569. Outlet
densities are provided for planning purposes when actual outlet locations are not known and cannot be
determined with available information. Actual designs must include outlets in work areas, office
automation outlets, private office outlets, conference rooms, and wall or access phones as necessary.
Design Guide | Working Draft
86 September 2019
Outlet densities are based on gross area (i.e. overall building footprint without deducting for areas such
as hallways, equipment rooms, and restrooms). Outlet configurations, densities, and locations for all
special-purpose spaces not identified in Table 2-1 must be determined by the user and the
telecommunications manager. The above requirements can be modified if it is validated (documented in
writing, signed and dated by the telecommunications manager) that mission operations require a quantity,
configuration or design other than specified herein.
Systems Furniture
Provide a minimum of one systems furniture work area outlet per single occupancy cubicle and a
minimum of two systems furniture outlets per cubicle designated for additional scanners, printers, copiers
or fax machines.

A Multi-user Telecommunications Outlet Assembly (MUTOA) is defined as a grouping in one location of
several telecommunications outlet/connectors. TIA-568-C.1 allows MUTOAs in an open office
environment. This option provides greater flexibility in an office that is frequently reconfigured. A MUTOA
facilitates the termination of single or multiple horizontal cables in a common location within a furniture
cluster or similar open area. The cables from MUTOAs to work stations in system furniture or open office
are supported by the systems furniture raceway and the length must be calculated in accordance with
TIA-568-C.1 when establishing the total channel length. MUTOAs do not include an additional connection
and are limited to terminating a maximum of 12 users. Locate MUTOAs and route cables within systems
furniture in accordance with TIA-568-C.1.
Design Guide | Working Draft
September 2019 87
Consolidation Point (CP)
A Consolidation Point (CP) is defined as an interconnection point within the horizontal cabling using TIA-
568-C.2 or TIA-568-C.3 compliant connecting hardware. It differs from the MUTOA in that it requires an
additional connection for each horizontal cable run. A CP may be useful when reconfiguration is frequent,
but not so frequent as to require the flexibility of the MUTOA. CP’s are limited to terminating a maximum
of 12 users. Locate CPs in accordance with TIA-568-C.1.
27 20 00 DATA COMMUNICATIONS
27 21 00 Data Communications Network Equipment
[UFC 3-580-01 2-8.3 Wireless Access Points (WAP)]
Wireless local area network (WLAN) system shall be designed in accordance with TIA
Telecommunications Systems Bulletin 162-A (TSB-162-A) Telecommunications Cabling Guidelines for
Wireless Access Points. TSB-162-A recommends the use of category 6A (or higher) twisted-pair and
OM3 (or higher) optical fiber cabling to support higher data rates and, in the case of twisted-pair cabling,
lower temperature rise when remote power is applied. However, the determination of whether a Category
6A (or higher) twisted-pair or OM3 (or higher) optical fiber cabling is used must be based on the following:
• Complexity of maintaining multiple cabling systems (Category 6 for work area outlets and Category
6A or optical fiber for support of WAPs)
• Funding constraints to procure and maintain multiple cabling systems and test equipment.
• Space to accommodate hardware associated with multiple cabling systems. For example, a Category
6A cabling system installed to support a wireless system must be terminated on Category 6A patch
panels.
Provide two twisted-pair cables, Category 6 or 6A terminated on standard 8-pin modular connectors or
two fiber multimode optical fiber strands, OM3 or higher for each wireless access point. Install the WAP
cabling infrastructure in the same manner as other telecommunications outlets required in this UFC.
Include the cable tray and conduit or J-hooks to support the cable connected to the WAP. The use of “J”
hooks, flexible cable tray(s), and alternative support systems specifically certified for the cable utilized is
permissible to support the WAPs from the cable tray. Do not exceed a 50 percent fill ratio for the “J”
hooks. Support horizontal cabling to distribution areas in cable tray(s).
Note: When funding permits, activities may utilize shielded twisted pair (STP) cabling for WAPs. Shielded
cables reduce the probability of alien crosstalk and also help to dissipate heat when the cable is used to
provide power.
